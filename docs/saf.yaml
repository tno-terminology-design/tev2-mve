# The `scopes` section contains a mapping between scopetags 
# that are used within the scope, and the associated scopedirs.
# This enables tools to find the SAF of these scopes,
# and from there all other directories, files etc. that live
# within them, e.g. to use/import their data.
#
scopes:
- scopetag: tev2 # name we use to identify the scope found at
  # the URL of the scope-directory:

# The `versions` section specifies the terminologies 
# that are actively maintained by the curators of this scope.

# the value of `defaultvsn` in the `scope`-section.
