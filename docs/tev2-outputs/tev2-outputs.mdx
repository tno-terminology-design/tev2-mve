# TEv2 outputs

When the [TEv2 tools](@tev2) are run using the [configuration file](@tev2)
`/docs/tev2-configs-for-testing.yaml`, they will output their results in this directory.

Note that since this file has the `.mdx` extension, it won't be treated by any of the tools.
That is because the configuration only specifies `.md` extensions to be treated.
If you want to treat this file, too, that must be configured
(alternatively, you can rename the file extension to `.md`).
