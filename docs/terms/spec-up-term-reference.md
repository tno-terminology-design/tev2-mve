# Spec-Up Term References

A [[ref: Term Reference]] (Spec-Up style) is a construct of the form `[[ref: {term}]]`, where `{term}` is (an alias of some) term defined in a [[ref: Spec-Up definition]].

This page would contain proper documentation about the concept that `Term 1`, or any of its [form phrases](@tev2), would refer to.

## Notes

Like [[ref: Term Two]] and [[ref: Term 3]], this term is defined for illustration purposes only.
