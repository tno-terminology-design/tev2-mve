# Minimal Viable Example (MVE) 

A **Minimal Viable Example (MVE)** is a very simple version of a GitHub repo that includes the minimal stuff for using the [TEv2 tools](@tev2) and demonstrating its results.

This includes:
- the actual documentation that is to be published;
- the files needed for generating the static website (e.g., the [workflow file](@);
- any other artifacts needed by the static website generate (e.g., CSS files, plugins, etc.)
- and, of course, the set of directories and files that [TEv2 tools](@tev2) need;

## Example

One example of an [MVE](@) is [the repo of which this page is a part](https://github.com/tno-terminology-design/tev2-mve).
